# FizzBuzz

## Description

FizzBuzz is a common coding interview challenge that requires the programmer to print numbers from 1 through n, but with specific replacements.

If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". If the number is divisible by

5, print "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

Each number or string should be followed by a newline character.
